This file will describe a "how-to" for decoding .BSQ files into 16-bit TIFF files

Requirements:

	Python 2.7

In order to use the bsq2tiffs program, several dependencies are required,
these dependencies can be satisfied with the following python packages.

    numpy
    scipy
    pillow
    pypng

As well as the following dependencies hosted in this repository's 'python' folder

	tifffile.c
	tifffile.py

to use the this program as is**, simply edit line 161 in the file 'convertBsqMulti.py'
and paste in the path to the directory storing your imaging sessions.

Currently this program will only look for bsq files within driectories located at the given path.

For example, consider your data is stored as follows

to decode the BSQ data you must pass the "/home/**USER**/**DATA_DIR**" path in order to decode these files.  

/home
	/**USER**
		/**DATA_DIR**
			/2016_12_***
				***.BSQ
				***.BSQ
				***.BSQ
			/2016_12_***
				***.BSQ
				***.BSQ
				***.BSQ

Once the program executes, the converted files can be found within the 'TIF' directory created in each subdir.


**A modified version of this script is in development to allow for passing this path directly into the program via comand line.
